# The Jupyter Notebook

This process must be manually started.

## Start Jupyter Notebook
Run start-script in:
/wettermonitor/jupyter/start.sh

This will run a container which will provide a Jupyter Notebook running on port: 8890
Available in browser with address: http://localhost:8890
Password: wettermonitor

The Jupyter Notebook is useful for testing new functions without having to rebuild anything (restart docker containers).
